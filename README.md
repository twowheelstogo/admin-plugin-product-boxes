## How to use

Install this plugin into reaction API before:

https://github.com/twowheelstogo/api-plugin-product-boxes

Open a terminal in your `reaction-development-platform` root directory. Run `make dev-link-reaction-admin` to ensure that `reaction-admin` is running in development mode. Without development mode enabled, changes made to the project's local files won't be built and won't take effect.

Once development mode is enabled, `cd` into your `reaction-admin` project's `/imports/plugins/custom` directory.

Clone the plugin:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:twowheelstogo/admin-plugin-product-boxes.git
```

Restart `reaction-admin`. You should now see the "Bundles" link in your sidebar on [localhost:4080](https://localhost:4080).
